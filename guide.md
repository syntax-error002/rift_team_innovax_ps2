RIFT 2026 HACKATHON
Graph Theory / Financial Crime Detection Track
MONEY MULING DETECTION CHALLENGE
Graph-Based Financial Crime Detection Engine

Multi-city Hackathon  •  Graph Theory Track


PROBLEM OVERVIEW
Money muling is a critical component of financial crime where criminals use networks of individuals ("mules") to transfer and layer illicit funds through multiple accounts. Traditional database queries fail to detect these sophisticated multi-hop networks.

Build a web-based Financial Forensics Engine that processes transaction data and exposes money muling networks through graph analysis and visualization.

⚠ Your solution MUST be deployed as a live web application with CSV file upload functionality.


INPUT SPECIFICATION
Your web application MUST accept CSV file upload with the following exact structure:

Column Name
Data Type
Description
transaction_id
String
Unique transaction identifier
sender_id
String
Account ID of sender (becomes a node)
receiver_id
String
Account ID of receiver (becomes a node)
amount
Float
Transaction amount in currency units
timestamp
DateTime
Format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS


REQUIRED OUTPUTS
⚠ CRITICAL: Outputs will be tested line-by-line against expected test case results. Exact format matching is required.


1. Interactive Graph Visualization
All account nodes (sender_id and receiver_id from CSV)
Directed edges representing money flow (sender → receiver)
ALL identified money muling rings clearly highlighted
Suspicious nodes MUST be visually distinct (different color/size/border)
Interactive: hovering/clicking nodes shows account details

2. Downloadable JSON Output File
Provide a download button for a JSON file with the following EXACT format:

{ "suspicious_accounts": [
    { "account_id": "ACC_00123", "suspicion_score": 87.5,
      "detected_patterns": ["cycle_length_3", "high_velocity"],
      "ring_id": "RING_001" } ],
  "fraud_rings": [
    { "ring_id": "RING_001", "member_accounts": ["ACC_00123", ...],
      "pattern_type": "cycle", "risk_score": 95.3 } ],
  "summary": { "total_accounts_analyzed": 500,
    "suspicious_accounts_flagged": 15, "fraud_rings_detected": 4,
    "processing_time_seconds": 2.3 }
}


Mandatory fields in suspicious_accounts array:
account_id (String)
suspicion_score (Float, 0–100, sorted descending)
detected_patterns (Array of strings)
ring_id (String)

3. Fraud Ring Summary Table
Display a table in the web UI showing each detected ring with:
Ring ID
Pattern Type
Member Count
Risk Score
Member Account IDs (comma-separated)

DETECTION PATTERNS — WHAT IS A MONEY MULING RING?
1. Circular Fund Routing (Cycles)
Money flows in a loop through multiple accounts to obscure the origin. Example: A → B → C → A
Detect cycles of length 3 to 5
All accounts in a detected cycle should be flagged as part of the same ring

2. Smurfing Patterns (Fan-in / Fan-out)
Many small deposits aggregated into one account, then quickly dispersed to avoid transaction reporting thresholds.
Fan-in: Multiple accounts send to one aggregator (10+ senders → 1 receiver)
Fan-out: One account disperses to many receivers (1 sender → 10+ receivers)
Use temporal analysis: Transactions within a 72-hour window are more suspicious

3. Layered Shell Networks
Money passes through intermediate "shell" accounts with low transaction counts before reaching the final destination.
Look for chains of 3+ hops where intermediate accounts have only 2–3 total transactions

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
Metric
Requirement
Processing Time
Upload to results display ≤ 30 seconds (datasets up to 10K transactions)
Precision Target
≥ 70% — minimize false positives
Recall Target
≥ 60% — catch most fraud rings
False Positive Control
MUST NOT flag legitimate high-volume merchants or payroll accounts


⚠ Your solution will be tested against hidden datasets containing both fraud patterns AND legitimate account traps designed to catch naive algorithms.
